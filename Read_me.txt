In this project of my portfolio, I want to explain how I did this. Firstly, I re-used and placed a few artworks to the project and it was made by me. I've spent many years to draw everything in Digital. Until I had discovered to make static website, such as HTML and CSS. Thankfully I learned and improved doing my work in less than 10 days. Besides I am getting started to develop my skills in coding.

If you are reading this about my thoughts of my portfolio.

Thank you and I would be appreciated to inspire by you, mostly sir Roque Jerico.
